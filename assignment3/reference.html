        <h2>Explaination for implementation of Requirement(2.4)</h2>
        <h3>Option 1: create two HTML or PHP files, each with a dedicated CSS file</h3>
        <p>I have created two Html pages, Index.html is the main file contains answers for assignment 3 integrated with
            titlepage.css,
            and another html file is reference.html which contains the references integrated with darktheme.css</p>

        <h3>Option 2: create one HTML or PHP file with a mechanism to enable a visitor to select the CSS file to use
        </h3>
        <p>To implement this option, I have utilized a toggle button positioned at the top-left corner of the webpage.
            Additionally, in the 'script.js' JavaScript file created for this assignment, I have developed a
            method called 'changeToggleStyle()' which dynamically switches the CSS files based on the user's selection.
        </p>
   
    <h3>Option 3: create one HTML or PHP file with a mechanism to automatically select the CSS file to use based on
        current time or date</h3>
    <p>To dynamically change css based on current time, in JS file added "windows.addEventlistner()" so that when
        webpage loads
        check for the time and select css file. If time is between morning 6 am to 6pm uses titlepage.css otherwise
        picks darktheme.css</p>
    
    <h3>Similarities and differences for these options</h3>
    <p>For all of these options, we need to specify the CSS filename in the HTML using the
        <link> tag and the href attribute.
        Additionally, for options 2 and 3, we are required to write JavaScript methods.
        Option 2 involves creating a simple function with an if-else condition that responds to user clicks on the
        toggle.
        Option 3 follows a similar approach, but it includes an additional step where a 'Load' event listener is added
        to select the CSS file based on the current time.
