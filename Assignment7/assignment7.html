    <h2>Particulate matter</h2>
    <p>Particulate matter (PM) refers to tiny particles of solids or liquids that are suspended in the air we breathe.
        These particles can vary in size and composition, ranging from dust and pollen to soot and aerosols.
        PM can be produced by natural sources like dust storms or wildfires, but human activities such as vehicle
        emissions, industrial processes, and burning of fossil fuels are major contributors.
        Inhalation of PM can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular issues, especially with long-term exposure, causing
        asthma, bronchitis, heart disease, and even premature death.</p>
    <h2>Ozone Health</h2>
    <p>

        Ground-level ozone (O3) is formed from pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds
        (VOCs) in sunlight.
        It can cause respiratory issues (coughing, chest pain), decrease lung function, and worsen asthma.
        Ozone levels are measured in parts per billion (ppb) or micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³) using air quality
        monitoring stations.
        High ozone concentrations prompt health advisories and impact vulnerable groups like the elderly and those with
        respiratory conditions
