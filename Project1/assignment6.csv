Frank,"Project is focusing on challenges of consuming API through different coding techniques. 
				Integrated Openweather API in web applications using 3 different frameworks PHP, Python, and JS.",https://167.99.253.247/csc543/rodriguezaf1/Assigment_5/home.html,5,8,This project is great and implemented all 3 options in triple modular strategy and used 3 different languages and frameworks to implement it.,How did you implement different cloud icons/images based on different weather conditions?,"Everything is good, along with latitude and longitude you could have added city or state for better user experience.",You can add UI validations for longitude and latitude fields for wrong user inputs.
Pierre Gustave ,"This project is about understanding what is web frameworks and how it works. Used 3 different frameworks for implementation of temperature conversion (Angular, Laravel and Html with PHP).",https://167.99.253.247/csc543/gustavep1/project1-research-main-php/project-research-main-php.php,5,6,Each Implementation is working fine and have given detailed descriptions about each of the mentioned frameworks.,I have no questions and everything looks good.,you could have added more diffirent temperature conversions .,Good work and this implementation can be expanded to bigger applications like conversion app with different conversion options like currency and weigh metrics and more.
Ian Cheung,Project is about Internet of Things with different operating systems and browsers. Using different implementations and visualizations to present research findings. ,https://167.99.253.247/csc543/cheungi1/Project%201/,5,6,"I have learnt many new operating system and framework names which I never heard before, in your implementations. I liked the idea of your different data visualizations and charts.",what made you to pick IOT? ,I have enjoyed your research finidings.You could have given example of some widely used IOT applications design.,You could have described much about importance of IOT in current technology trends.
Q Thompson ,"Using 3 different APIs, integrating them with web applications and displaying the APIs response in UI ",https://167.99.253.247/csc543/thompsonq4/index.html,5,8,"Your UI designs, API Implementations and your research findings given in summary page are impressive.",how did you handle API key masking in your project?,I really don’t have any recommendations and everything looks fine.,You could have given technical description about API Integrations.
Thomas Sullivan ,Making web development more accessible for peopls with varying skills and learning to use tools effectively to achieve desired outcome.,https://167.99.253.247/csc543/sullivant20/Project1_Landing_Page.html,5,7,Research problem and UI design looks good.,Did you take any inputs from students for this project?,Any specific use cases that are used for this project?,No Recommendations
